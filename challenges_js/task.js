//Changing the values, this is possible because the variables 
//are let.

    console.log("I drive a " + modelOfCar)
    console.log("Hi, my name is " +firstName+ " and I drive a " + modelOfCar)
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${firstName}. And I drive a ${modelOfCar}.`)
//this method removes the need to manually place spaces in string quotes.
